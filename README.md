# Midterm Lab Task 1 - Data Cleaning Using Excel
In this lab activity, I worked on cleaning and preparing a messy dataset in Excel. The goal was to make the data organized and accurate by following these steps:
## Data Cleaning Process
- Open the raw file
- Trim extra spaces
- Adjust column and row width and height for better readability
- Create a TransID and ID, then drag down to generate sequential numbers.
- Seperate Customer Name into First Name and Last Name 
- Assign an ID to those who need a ID
- Remove NULL values
## Normalization 
- Create a NEW sheet for normalization 
- Categorize data into separate groups (e.g., Rating)
- Identify fields that need normalization (e.g., Rating) and assign numerical values (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4)
- Remove duplicates and sort the data
- Copy the normalized values back into the original data
- Drag down to apply the changes based on the new normalized sheet
