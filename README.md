# Finals Lab Task 1 - MySQL Basics (Multi-Level Company)
In this lab activity, I worked on making a database for a company that has many levels using MySQL. The goal was to create tables, add data, and run SQL queries to get the information needed. Here are the steps I followed:

- Created a new database
  - Used CREATE DATABASE to make the database.
  -Used USE to select the database.
- Created tables
  - Used CREATE TABLE to make tables (e.g., Employees, Departments).
  - Added columns with correct data types (e.g., INT, VARCHAR, DATE).
  - Set PRIMARY KEY and FOREIGN KEY for relationships.
- Checked the table structures
  - Used DESCRIBE or viewed the structure in phpMyAdmin to review the design of each table.
